        <h1>OWOLABI BABATUNDE</h1>
        <p>
          I am an ambitious and focused individual who is able to use his own
          initiative and is comfortable working in a busy office environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal from this program is to be equipped with tech skills, tools,
          resources and community that will aid my journey into the tech world.
          To take me from a complete beginner to a stage where I can be
          confident enough to study further on my own and put my learned skills
          to work in leading organisations and communities.
